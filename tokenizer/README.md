# Interpreter: README
By: Anden Acitelli.2

## Submitted Files: 
- **main.py**: The runnable file. It interfaces with the tokenizer.
- **tokenizer.py**: The file that contains the Tokenizer class and all its related functionality.
- **1.txt**, **2.txt**, **3.txt**: The test cases he provided on piazza, for your convenience.
- **regex.md**: Explanation of the regex I use to check if something is an identifier. It got complicated enough that I felt some explanation was in order. Was fun to learn, though.

## Compilation / Running
- Built in Python, so you should just have to run `python main.py <filename>`.
    - NOTE: Providing a filename to read the source code from as a command-line argument is mandatory. It will crash if you don't. 
    - Tested on Python 3.9.0. Any version of Python3 will likely work (if not also Python2), but I make no guarantees for anything other than Python 3.9.0.
